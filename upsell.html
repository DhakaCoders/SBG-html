                    <p><strong>>>> Do you think you have more struggle losing weight than most people? </strong></p>
                    <p>>>> Do you want to do EVERYTHING in your power to try to eliminate those stubborn pounds now?</p>
                    <p><strong> >>> Do you feel hopeless and sometimes depressed about how bad your energy levels have become -- <i>and do you sometimes feel that no one understands what you're going through?</i> </strong></p>
                    <p><strong>>>> Have you had this excess weight and lack of energy chronically, for 12 months or more? <span> And does it feel like there is no end in sight?</span></strong></p>
                    <p><strong>>>> Do your family and friends think you're too old and feeble to do anything... <span>and leave you out of activities because they know you'll just complain about being tired?</span></strong></p>
                    <p><strong>>>>  Do you want to STOP or greatly reduce your pain in the next 30 days and see an incredible difference in the months that follow?</strong></p>
                  </div>
                  <div class="sbg-sidebar-upsell-btm">
                    <p>If so, I KNOW what you're going through.</p>
                    <p>I've been there myself with a complete lack of energy, unable to even get out of bed, and relentless stubborn pounds I couldn't lose.</p>
                    <p><strong>And I experienced my once-vibrant and active body slowly deteriorate from a lack of energy, feeling apathetic <i>(after many failed diets),</i> bloating, debilitating headaches and a lot more.</strong></p>
                    <p>And I know that typical solutions that doctors and "experts" recommend simply do NOT work.</p>
                    <p>Especially injections, surgery, useless medical devices, popping pills, and more. They all give temporary relief at best.</p>
                    <p>But I realized <u>nature ALWAYS has a solution</u> to our problems.</p>
                    <p>Especially when it comes to fruits and vegetables.</p>
                    <p><strong>Which is why I discovered that most people with chronic pervasive inflammation can benefit greatly from what I call a SUPERBOOST GREENS BLITZ DOSE.</strong></p>
                    <p>A SuperBoost Greens Blitz Dose is when you use SuperBoost Greens 3-4 times every day for your first 30 days.</p>
                    <p>Basically, each time you're about to eat a meal or have a snack, just stir up a scoop of SuperBoost Greens with 8 oz of water.</p>
                    <p>And keep doing this until you've gone through 4 jars <i>(your free jar + 3 more jars)</i> in your first 30-45 days...</p>
                    <p><strong>Because when you've have been in struggling with weight loss and lack of energy for years, You CANNOT follow the same dosage that is typically recommended for normal people.</strong></p>
                    <p>You HAVE to go above and beyond. </p>
                    <p>It's the only way to see real results.</p>
                    <p>Which is why I knew I had to offer enough extra jars to make sure you can take part in the SuperBoost Greens BLITZ dose now, and relieve your pain for the long-term.</p>
                    <p><strong>But I know what you're going through because I've seen it happen myself so I know it is NOT fair to charge you $239.85 to buy this at regular price ($79.95 per jar).</strong></p>
                    <p>So I put together a one-time discount to offer a HUGE discount to help you out right now.</p>
                    <p><strong>Which is why on this page only and since you're a new customer, <u>you get 2 MORE FREE JARS when you Buy 1 at MSRP less your special members-only discount ($69.95)... that's 3 JARS for your BLITZ DOSE at just $239.85 $23.31/each!</u></strong></p>
                    <p>That's over 67% OFF in total!</p>
                    <p>Plus it comes with <strong>FREE</strong> Priority Shipping.</p>
                    <p>And it's the ONLY way to do the SuperBoost Greens BLITZ DOSE now to completely transform your life by reducing joint pain, stiffness, swelling and more in just 30 days!</p>

                    <p><strong>But do NOT leave this page without upgrading because if you do, you'll have to pay $239.85 for this same package :/</strong></p>
